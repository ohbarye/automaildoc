        Hey, Chris!

        As you know, we keep the meetups on a regular monthly basis: the first Monday of the month, at 7:30pm.

        Due to the vacation constraints of this season, the August session will be held on the 14th (i.e. the 2nd Monday).

        Apart from that, same place, same time. ðŸŽ‰
